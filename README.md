  This assignment introduced me to neural networks using PyTorch. I built a straightforward feed-forward
  model and trained it to see how each part of the process works — from tensors and layers to loss and
  optimisation. It was a simple exercise, but it helped me get to grips with how deep learning operates
  at a basic level.
