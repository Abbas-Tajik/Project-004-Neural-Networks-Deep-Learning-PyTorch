  This assignment introduced me to neural networks using PyTorch. I built a straightforward feed-forward
  model and trained it to see how each part of the process works — from tensors and layers to loss and
  optimisation. It was a simple exercise, but it helped me get to grips with how deep learning operates
  at a basic level.

  This project incorporates ideas and reference material from several publicly available sources. 
  The image-classification demonstration adapts concepts from Chapter 2 of 
  <em>Deep Learning with PyTorch</em> by Thomas Viehmann, Eli Stevens, and Luca Antiga 
  (Manning Publications), and the associated GitHub repository. 
  Additional reference implementations were reviewed from the 
  <em>PyTorch Pocket Reference</em> by Joe Papa, whose accompanying example code is also available online. 
  These resources provided guidance on model structure, training loops, and general PyTorch workflow, 
  which I adapted for my own learning and experimentation.
